Hey!

To fork this repo you need to:

Click the button in the top right that says "fork"...

Then select your profile.

GitHub has now made a copy of our repository on you your profile.

Now click "Clone or download" and copy the URL that is displayed.

Now, open your terminal and navigate to wherever you're storing your code - for example code/week1/.

Type

```javascript
 git clone <PasteURLHere> 
```

(of course you need to replace "PasteURLHere" with the URL you just copied):

Run the command (press enter). This will create a new folder on your computer. called Fork.

cd into that folder like normal and open it in vsCode (or the editor of your choice) to start working with it!

When you clone a github repo it will also set up a remote called "origin" so there is no need to do the whole git remote add origin ... thing.
